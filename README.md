# ðŸŽ¨ Mondrian Painting

<p> Piet Mondrian was a Dutch painter and art theoretician who is regarded as one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. He was one of the pioneers of 20th-century abstract art, as he changed his artistic direction from figurative painting to an increasingly abstract style, until he reached a point where his artistic vocabulary was reduced to simple geometric elements. </p>

The project shows one of his famous paintings. It was developed in HTML and CSS.
